(2 pts) Program description; purpose of the assignment.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Throughout this assignment we constructed multiple different types of minimal
 priority queues using different data structures.
 We used binary heap, vector, and linked lists to construct the MPQs.
 After constructing the MPQs we use a CPU_Job class to mimic a processor.
 The files were read in from a text file and then outputed to another text
 file.
 The purpose of the assignment was to better our understanding of different
 data structures and the minimal prioritiy queue and how to write fast algorithm
s that best adhere to design principles (such as not running super long).

\begin_layout Standard
To compile the program I used visual studio for most of the implementations
 except the linked list in which I used the TAMU servers, because the linked
 list function was running for over 45 minutes on my computer but only for
 around 10-15 minutes on the server.
 Through the header files for each data structure I included a main function
 that was commented out that has some test cases I used to test the data
 structure.
 In the actual main.cpp I included all 3 main functions (commented out) I
 used for the CPU_Job phase.
 To run the different main functions just remove the comments and you can
 enter the text file name to input the different text files.
 The output for the CPU_Job is to a text file named OutSize

I used templates for all the functions so that you can enter any sort of
 data type, as specified in the instructions.
 Also I wrote all the different data structures in their own header files
 and included them in the main.cpp.
 For each header file I had a saved main function in the header file that
 consists of the test cases I used.
 Furthermore, I included comments on the Big-O of each functio

(5 pts) Discussion of the implementation and running time in the terms of
 big-O.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
For the vector data structure I had 3 templated functions is_emptyy(), remove_mi
n(), and insert().
 The is_emptyy() returns a bool value back and has a constant Big-O of O(1).
 The remove_min() function searches the vector for the smallest element
 notes the index of the element, removes the element from the vector, and
 returns the element, since the for loop runs for a N amount of times the
 Big-O notation is O(n).
 The remove_min() functions runs for a constant time of O(1), since it only
 pushes to the back of the vector.
 For the linked list data structure I followed a similiar style as the vector
 classes and had 3 same templated functions.
 The is_emptyy() and insert() both have a Big-O of O(1) since they contain
 1 instruction each that runs for a constant time.
 The is_emptyy() has 1 compare statement and returns a bool and the insert()
 pushes to the front of the linked list.
 The remove_min() function uses a for loop with two iterators, one to run
 through the linked list and one to save the location of the lowest value.
 The first iterator is compared to a temporary value that is initially set
 to the beginning of the list, if the temporary value is greater than the
 temp value is changed to the iterator value and the second iterator value
 is updated to know which location the lowest value exists at.
 The Big-O notation is O(n) since it iterates through the entire list n
 amount of times.
